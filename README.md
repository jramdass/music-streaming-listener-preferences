# README

This project uses the dataset [Global Music Streaming Trends & Listener Insights](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/global-music-streaming-trends-and-listener-insights) from kaggle.

I am setting up a sample API to learn Ruby on Rails.

## Sample Screenshots

I have included screenshots of this application running locally in the screenshots folder.
I will update them as the design of pages change.
